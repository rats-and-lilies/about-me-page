<p style="color:#08e21ace">Hello! My name is Lilith, but my friends call me Lil or Lily. I'm really into trading card games,<br>
    video games, listening to and discovering new music, writing music, making art, and watching anime<br>
    with my partner of 6 years. I've been playing music since I was 14, which I can understand how that <br>
    would lead one to incorrectly assume that I'm good at it! Used to make industrial music, but currently <br> 
    working on a Folk Punk project.
